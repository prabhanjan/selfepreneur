          <h2>ABC of selfepreneurship.</h2>
          <p>Selfpreneuer: Being a selfpreneuer is being self sufficient or self-independent. In life there comes certain instances where we have to learn alone and go through the hardships alone. During this time we learn from our experience and environment. It is very important that we stay updated with what is happening in the world and brush up on our strengths. As we grow up, we may go through some tough obstacles that will make us a strong, independent person. But sometimes life happens and we lose our sense of independence.</p>

The next time, he probed why the Co was spending on dog biscuits. He was reminded about his switch to dogs. He ordered dogs to be recorded & their barking played inside the hangars. He got rid of the dogs & biscuits :)<br/>My lessons :<br/>- The \'silly\' money you save ISN\'T about moneys. It\'s about creating a MINDSET not to waste money.<br/>- Costs escalate very fast. Revenues don\'t. I prefer spending with lots of caution.<br/>- In funding winters, frugality reigns supreme. In fact, when summer comes, you have stopped bothering about the weather'}]
